I wanted to make a fisherman character for my game about fishing. The game I'm making has a cartoony aesthetic to it. When I was making him, he was turning out very blocky, so I decided to embrace it and make it a smooth and blocky appearance. I plan on adding some pins to his hat to add some color, He will have a navy blue top and dark green hat and pants, with the color being on his hat to draw attention up there, the shorts will also draw some attention to his legs since he will have lighter skin color compared to his dark apparel. I am confused about the assignment, we have yet to learn how to set up a rig where its all one big piece! I did try to add more edges around his arms, legs, and mouth so it wont stretch the surround topology when he moves
